Hello world!

This is a diary documenting my progress as a chess player. I'm a newbie at age
38, so I do not expect to go very far, but I'm keen to learn and to improve.

My current interest in chess comes from a chess tournament we are having at
work — as well as of course the Netflix show, _The Queen's Gambit_ — though I have
learned the rules as a child from my father, who is a keen player.

I will try to write a little something about each game I play, as well as some
other chess-related bits and pieces. Don't expect anything amazingly
interesting or ground-breaking here, the goal is to merely document my
progress.

The game above is round 4 of the chess tournament at work. I was playing black.
I was feeling confident at the beginning, but it all kind of went to hell after
white double-attacked with bishop and queen on move 15. I soon lost my own
queen (move 21), and it was all downhill from there.

My current thinking is that I really need to improve my opening strategy, as I
kind of develop my pieces rather haphazardly, and also my mid-game tactics, and
resilience in the face of psychological pressure (some might say I need to
improve everything!).

Let's try to improve.
